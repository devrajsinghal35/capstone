This repository includes code for the paper "**[Toward Autonomous and Efficient Cybersecurity: A Multi Objective AutoML based Intrusion Detection System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11240569/)**" published in **IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking (TMLCN)**. In this work, we propose a novel and comprehensive Multi-Objective optimization (MOO) and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) framework that enables efficient and autonomous intrusion detection, especially for IoT systems that need to balance model effectiveness and efficiency/complexity, holding the potential to achieve fully autonomous cybersecurity in resource-constrained systems like IoT. To achieve autonomous and efficient intrusion detection, the proposed MOO-AutoML framework automates all critical procedures of the data analytics pipeline, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Abstract of The Paper
With increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and rising demand for network automation, autonomous cybersecurity mechanisms are becoming critical for securing modern networks. The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems amplifies these challenges, as resource-constrained IoT devices demand scalable and efficient security solutions. In this work, an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is proposed for autonomous and optimized cyber-attack detection in modern networking environments. The proposed IDS framework integrates two primary innovative techniques: Optimized Importance and Percentage-based Automated Feature Selection (OIP-AutoFS) and Optimized Performance, Confidence, and Efficiency-based Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (OPCE-CASH). These components optimize feature selection and model learning processes to strike a balance between intrusion detection effectiveness and computational efficiency. This work presents the first IDS framework that integrates all four AutoML stages and employs multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize detection effectiveness, efficiency, and confidence for deployment in resource-constrained systems. Experimental evaluations over two benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed MOO-AutoML IDS outperforms state-of-the-art IDSs, establishing a new benchmark for autonomous, efficient, and optimized security for networks. Designed to support IoT and edge environments with resource constraints, the proposed framework is applicable to a variety of autonomous cybersecurity applications across diverse networked environments.
